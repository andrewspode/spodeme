# This Article is in the Archives

You're looking for content from the earlier days of [Spode's Abode](/) - those were some good times!

This particular article is currently tucked away in my archives. If it's something you think you'd enjoy seeing, please **get in touch** and I'll see about putting it back online for you.

You might also want to try searching for it on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20050801000000*/spodesabode.com) - they've captured quite a bit of the old site over the years.

In the meantime, why not check out some of my newer, retro-inspired pieces in [my current articles](/articles.html)?
