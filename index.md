Hi! I'm Andrew Spode. I'm a former technology journalist _(amongst other things)_ who has somehow found himself as a middle aged man, rummaging through piles of scrap looking for things worth restoring and refurbishing to sell on eBay.

Almost everything I sell was destined to be chopped up with an axe and never to be seen again. I work very hard to help the growing number of people interested in retro computing and gaming. The revival of this website, is so that I can share my experience and knowledge with those that have the time and skills to do these things for themselves but don't want to pay for my help.

I regularly contribute photography and BIOS dumps to [TheRetroWeb](https://www.google.com/search?q=TheRetroWeb+Andrew+Spode&tbm=isch) and CD/Floppy images to [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/@andrewspode). 


As a teenager, Spode's Abode was run out of my bedroom, but I quickly found myself writing for a number of publications in the UK and had content syndicated around the world. Computer Shopper was where I cut my teeth, before working for the likes of Custom PC _(where I also wrote their benchmark suite, aptly dubbed "SpodeMark")_, my column at The Inquirer and my time as Tech. Ed. of TrustedReviews before it was purchased.

There's not much to be found of my technology journalism days online anymore, as when I moved my career forward I spent quite some time having content or bylines removed due to the confusion it was causing. I still have some backups of the original site, but for now, that's where they will stay...
