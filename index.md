Hi! I'm Andrew Spode. ~1999-2009, I was a technology journalist who specialised in testing and evaluating computer components. Now, as a middle-aged man, things have gone full circle as I find myself rummaging through piles of scrap looking for the same items, so I can refurbish them for [sale on eBay](/shop) to support the retro gaming community.

I'm also known for my time as a [mountain bike trials rider](https://www.youtube.com/thinkbikes), a [software engineer](http://linkedin.com/in/spode) and a singer, with my most popular song being "[Fluffy Little Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fyFzmdLZp0)" with over 30 million streams.

The revival of this website is so that I can share my experience and knowledge with those that have the time and skills to do these things for themselves but don't want to pay for my help.

I regularly contribute photography and BIOS dumps to [TheRetroWeb](https://www.google.com/search?q=TheRetroWeb+Andrew+Spode&tbm=isch) and CD/Floppy images to [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/@andrewspode).

As a teenager, Spode's Abode was run out of my bedroom, but I quickly found myself writing for a number of publications in the UK and had content syndicated around the world. Computer Shopper was where I cut my teeth, before working for the likes of Custom PC _(where I also wrote their benchmark suite, aptly dubbed "SpodeMark")_, my column at The Inquirer and my time as Technical Editor of TrustedReviews.

There's not much to be found of my technology journalism days online anymore, as when I moved my career forward I spent quite some time having content or bylines removed due to the confusion it was causing. I still have some backups of the original site, but for now, that's where they will stay...
