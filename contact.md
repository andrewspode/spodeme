## What Can I Help With?

### 🛒 Items for Sale

If you'd like to inquire about any items I have for sale, the best way to reach me is by messaging me [directly via eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/cnt/intermediatedFAQ?requested=andrewspode). 

eBay protects both the buyer and the seller, and it allows me to sell internationally with ease, so I prefer to keep sales inside the platform.

However, if you need a custom / large order, it may be worth talking to me about it off-platform using my contact details below, as they monitor all communications and sometimes block conversations they don't like.

### 🔧 Repair Work

Typically speaking, it's easier and cheaper to buy an item I have [already refurbished](/shop), however in some cases you may want to get something you already own brought back to life.

I regularly undertake capacitor replacements (recapping), trace repairs, BIOS chip replacements, slot transplants, socket replacements and general refurbishment and repair as part of bringing my items back to life. There's no reason I can't do that for you too.

So if you're sitting on your childhood PC and something similar won't cut it, get in touch.

### 🤝 Collaboration

As a still active software developer, I may be interested in short-lived projects on a consultancy basis, but I am not interested in full-time employment. _(Yes, that means you, recruiters)_.

I am always open to discussing collaboration that benefits the retro community, archival and maintaining computing history.
